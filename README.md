## `mCube`: Multinomial multi-state micro-level reserving model
=========================================================================

This repository contains the code for an application on simulated data of the model presented in the article: mCube: Multinomial Micro-level reserving Model.

## Abstract of the article 
==========================================================================
This paper presents a multinomial multi-state micro-level reserving
model, denoted mCube. We propose a unified framework for mod-
elling the time and the payment process for IBNR and RBNS claims
and for modeling IBNR claim counts. We use multinomial distribu-
tions for the time process and spliced mixture models for the payment
process. We illustrate the strong performance of the proposed model
on a real data set of a major insurance company consisting of bod-
ily injury claims. In our application the proposed model produces a
best estimate distribution that is centered around the true reserve.

## Starting point:  
============================================================================
- R version: 3.6 or later.

## How to proceed: 
=============================================================================

Each folder contains an implementation of  an individual claims reserving model on simulated data and can be executed after downloading the required libairies.
